# inview.js

Inview.js is a lightweight simple library for manipulating elements when they appear in the viewport.

## Instructions

Include the script at the bottom of your page (right before the closing body-tag).

```
<script src="dist/inview-min.js"></script>
```

Give the elements you want to monitor the class `in-view`.

Then those elements are also given the class `visible` when you scroll and they come into the viewport.

Easy right?
